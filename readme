This is a fork of the IRremote library for the Arduino.

It has been gutted to significantly reduce code and data use on the
ATtiny series of AVRs.

To see the original, go to http://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote

To install this, go to your Arduino libraries directory
(/Users/<you>/Documents/Arduino/libraries on Windows,
~/Documents/Arduino/libraries on OSX and probably other unices) and run:

git clone https://github.com/nrw505/Arduino-TinyRemote.git TinyRemote

The TinyRemote library should be available next time you start the
Arduino IDE.
